# Getting Started with the barebones template

To use this template, clone this repo into whatever directory suits you (I recommend naming the directory `cra-template-barebones`). Do not run npm install, as there is no need!

Then you can simply execute  
 `npx create-react-app my-app --template file:../path/to/cra-template-barebones`

 That's it.
